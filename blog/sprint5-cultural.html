    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>At the moment, all I know is that I want to work within the tech industry as a programmer or developer. Long-term, I have a bit of an idea but nothing concrete.</p>

    <h3>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What sort of impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</h3>
    <p>I'd like to use the skills I learn from Dev Academy to get my foot in the door of the tech industry.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Not sure what sort of impact I'd like to make once I leave Dev Academy. All I know is that this is what I want to be doing right now.</p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>My biggest strengths will be my ability to communicate my weaknesses and frustrations to get the exact help that I will need</p>
    <p>And my biggest limitations will be my lack of technical skill or experience.</p>

    <h3>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>Everything is still the same. I don't think it will hinder me too much during bootcamp.</p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be? While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we would like you to consider here. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc.</h3>
    <p>Adjusting to a student lifestyle. At the moment, I have all of the freedom and abilities to do what I want when I want so going back to having very little income, living off a really tight budget, potentially giving up my car and just having to go back to living like a student again is probably going to be my gigest challenge.</p>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
    <p>Living lean lol</p>

    <h3>At Dev Academy we have a large focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on? For example, this could be things around communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self awareness and reflective skills.</h3>
    <p>Staying focused and getting things done. I'd like to improve my ability to set a goal, and complete it. I mean, it's not bad, I'd just like to improve it by spending less time procrastinating, and more time being effective and productive.</p>

    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>High. Somewhat unrealisitc. However, in my mind, if I set my expectations high and then I fall short, at least I'd fall short further than if I were to fall short setting my expectations low.</p>

    <h3>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h3>
    <p>Tutors, facilitators, fellow peers, Google, Youtube, and more. There are many ways to seek information. The most timely is the one that delivers the info you're seeking in the shortest amount of time possible.</p>

    <h3>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>

    <p>I will manage my workload by setting a daily work schedule, having small milestones I should have achieved by certain dates and times, as well as having a certain amount of work compelted as well. Whether it's with others or on my own, regularly reflecting on my goals will keep me focused on what's important and what isn't. The way I will manage working productively with others is by having a main goal I work towards with small milestones I aim to achieve along the way, and regularly reflecting on those goals to keep me focused and aligned. This will I ensure I communicate when I need to, ask for help when I need to, work hard when I need to, and so much more. In order to manage workloads and productivity levels, I will keep my eyes on the prize. </p>
