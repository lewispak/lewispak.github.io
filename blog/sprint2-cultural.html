        <h1> Learning Reflections</h1>

        <h3>
            Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?
        </h3>

        <p> 
            In simple terms, I setup my very first blog post by creating an html document which is used to create the foundation of a web page (page you see on the internet in your internet browser (such as Chrome, Safar, Firefox, etc.))
        </p>

        <h3> 
            How are you finding working with the timeboxes? 
        </h3>
        <p>
            Last week it was quite difficult just because I wasn't familiar with the structure of the class of how I could best follow the teaching material. This week it's a whole lot easier because I am now familiar with the course platform, how to follow course material, and how to use the tools that were initially presented.
        </p>

        <h2>Learn HTML and CSS</h2>
        
        <h3>
            What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
        </h3>
        <p>
            This week, my obstacle was time management. Because I'm still also trying to balance full-time work, managing study and work became a massive obstacle this week.
            
            The way I overcame this obstacle is by getting very clear about what my goal is and how I am going to achieve it. With that clarity, I was able to distinguish what I need to focus on more and what I needed to stop doing in order to achieve my goal.
        </p>

        <h3>
            What are of you proud of from this challenge?
        </h3>

        <p>
            I am proud of my ability to overcome challenges, frustration, and overwhelm with poise, control, and a clear head (not always the case.)
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge
        </h2>
        
        <p><strong>
            Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS. </strong> 
        </p>

        <p>
            A really helpful video tutorial I came across was of one that described HTML and CSS as a builder and artist (for the sake of this post, I'm going to CSS the designer.)

            Basically, the way HTML and CSS were explained through this analogy is that HTML built the house while CSS designed it.

            In other words, HTML (the builder) built the structure and foundations of the site we were building, while CSS (the designer) decorated and furnished what was built.

            For example, let's say you wanted to build a brand new house. In order to do that, you'd have a builder (HTML) build the entire thing, while the decorators (CSS) would paint, style, and furnish the place.
        </p>

        <h3>Any moments of surprise or joy? </h3>

        <p>There was a moment of clarity about the course which reduced overwhelm and simplified the entire study process for me. That made me very joyful.</p>

        <h3>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</h3>

        <p>
        
            If HTML and CSS were animals, HTML would be a work-horse while CSS would be a Peacock.

        The reason for this is because work-horses are exactly that. They're raised and trained to do a specific set of task in order to fulfill jobs, increase productivity, and get work done. I believe this relates to HTML because without it, work wouldn't get done.

        And the reason I believe CSS would be a Peacock is because Peacocks are bright and colorful, which is exactly what CSS delivers to web development and design.
