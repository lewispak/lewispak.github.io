        <h1>What is emotional intelligence?</h1>

        <p>Emotional intelligence is one's capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships with good judgement and an ability to understand to share the feelings of another.</p>

        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>

        <p>IQ (Intelligence Quitient) is a score calculated from of several stadardized integgigence tests.</p>

        <p>EQ (emotional quitient) is an individuals ability to identify, evalutate, control, and express emotions.</p>

        <p>IQ is used to determine an individual's academic abilities while EQ is a better indicator of one's possible success (The Dunedin Study).</p>

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

        <p>According to the Dunedin Study, the number one determining factoring regarding one's success or failure in life is one's ability to control their emotions. In other words, how well someone is at identifying, evaluating, controling, and expressing their emotions (EQ) is the most important determining factor in the success or failure of a person's pursuit in life.</p>

        <p>Therefore, being good at controling, regulating, and managing your emotions, desires, outburst, frustrations, desires, and temptations is important because it plays a critical role in your ability to succeed at whatever you choose to pursue.</p>
