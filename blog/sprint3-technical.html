   <h2> The Different Between HTML & CSS</h2>

   <p> The way I see HTML is that HTML is the structure of a house (the frames for a building, etc.) While CSS is the paint, the color, the design of the home. </p>

   <h2> Control Flow & Loops </h2>

   <p> <a href="https://youtu.be/hy0iq48c0YA">Control flow</a> allows us to run functionality based on certain conditions. i.e. if/else statements etc.</p>

   <p> <a href="https://youtu.be/hy0iq48c0YA">Looping</a> allows us to repeat behavior until a condition has been met.</p>

   <h2> What's The Dom? </h2>
   <p> <a href="https://youtu.be/XD7fYLQeQIg">The DOM</a> stands for the Document Object Model</p>

   <p> D = Document = A file (which in our case is an HTML file, just like a .doc file, mp4, mp3, jpeg, etc.</p>

   <P> O = Object = the objects within the file = the tags within our HTML file = htmls tags, header tags, body tags, button tag, and more... </P>

   <p> M = Model = How you layout all of these structures. E.g. html tags, head tags, body tags, title tags, etc. all laid out properly and all of their different levels.</p>

   <p> In short, the DOM is the model of all of the objects within the docoment(s) you're looking to display. For example, if you have an HTML document, then the DOM for that particular file would be the html tags over the head and body tags which wrap the child tags within themselves.</p>

   <h2> The Difference Between Accessing Data From Arrays and Object </h2>

   <p>Arrays is a list of certain variables, i.e. names, or ages, or heights, or weights, etc. While objects give you multiple variables and data values, i.e. name, and age, and height, and weight, etc.  </p>

   <h2> Functions and Why They're Useful </h2>

   <p> Functions are basically a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value that you program it to. </p>
