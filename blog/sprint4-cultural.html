        <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>

        <p>
            Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset is all about how our brains are constanstly evolving, growing, and making new neaural pathways.
            <br>
            Contrary to popular belief, our brains are actually maluable and are able to continually grow even late into our adult years.
            <br>
            This goes against traditional Neauroscience which used to state that our brains were fixed and that once you got to a certain age, there is no hope for learning anything further.
            <br>
            This is a massive breakthrough in science as it means that you're never too old to lern new tricks. All you need to do is be willing to learn and grow, and to be committed and persistent as well.
            <br>
            Having a mindset that is open to new ideas, non-judgemental, and observative (a.k.a having a Growth Mindset) helps very much in making these new neural pathways and connections in learning any new skill or expertise.
