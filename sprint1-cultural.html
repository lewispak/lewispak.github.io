        <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration</h1>

        <h2>Personal Values</h2>

        <p>
            Over the last couple of days, I've struggled with this exercise. Not because of the exercise itself, but because of the depth of thought this exercise has forced me to go into.

            Long story short - It started at personal values, then it ended with me asking what the meaning of life is.

            You see struggle now?

            Anyway, through a bit of soul-searching, I was able to deduce that it came down to living a life you're excited and happy to live. Because why would you want to do anything else?

            Hence the theme of my blog.

            One of the things that makes me happy is the movie, "I love you, man."

            One of the things that makes the characters in the film happy is fish tacos.

            Basically, I'm pretty much promoting a life of happiness, joy, and fulfillment which I guess could be considered a very major value of mine.

            If you’re doing something you love, I’m all for it.

            If not (and I understand life gets in the way sometimes), then do what you can to increase your chances of doing so.
        </p>

        <h2>How I see myself vs. How Others See Me</h2>

        <p>
            I once watched a video of a psychological experiment where participants are asked a set of questions that, unknowingly to them, revealed a little something about themselves to the researchers.

            Two of those questions being:

            What’s your favorite animal, and why?
            What’s your favorite item of clothing, and why?

            When I did this exercise and answered these two questions, my answers were:

            Bear - Because they can do anything. They can climb trees, swim, run quickly across land, and they’re ridiculously strong.
            A black Levi’s Denim Jacket I had because it could be dressed up, dressed down, it was cool, and it was a playful piece of clothing (for men anyway.)

            What participants didn’t know what these two questions revealed the following:

            The first question revealed to researchers how participants see themselves.
            The second question revealed to researchers how other people perceive the participant.

            I found this rather shocking because after asking my nieces and nephews what they thought, “cool” was definitely NOT an adjective they used.

            And I guess this all ties in with how I live my life and the limitations and strengths I noticed I have in a professional environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Professional Development</h2>

        <p>
            Professionally, this would be the third career path I’ve chosen to pursue professionally. And I guess it comes back to me perceiving myself as somebody who can do it all (even though I know I can’t). But the pursuit of being well-rounded in many areas of my life is one I seem to find worthwhile.

            And as I said, it can be both a strength and a weakness.

            My broad depth of knowledge, skills, and life experiences tends to allow me to cross-reference many different pieces of information in ways other people may not even think of. However, it also tends to leave me constantly being stimulated by new ideas, approaches, and possibilities - sometimes to the point of sacrificing what’s right in front of me just because I don’t find it very stimulating anymore.

            It’s something I’m working on, and because it’s a brand new challenge, it’s one that is quite captivating as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            Overall, balancing my desire to be good at everything with the reality of time and energy limitations is something I constantly battle. The pursuit in itself is the fun part, however, I know I need to settle down a little and be a bit more practical in my ambitions.

            On the other hand, what’s the point of living a life you’re not happy with, eh? Haha.
