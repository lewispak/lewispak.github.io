    <h2>
        CSS Box Model
    </h2>

    <p>
        This is all pretty much paraphrased from the site W3Schools which is the world's largest web developer site.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anyway, let's get into it!
    </P>

    <p>
        Every HTML element can pretty much considered a box. Paragraphs, images, and even healines can all be considered boxes.

        In CSS, this "box" is referred to as the term "box model" whenever we're talking about design and layout.

        It's a desgin model that is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It's made up of:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Margin</li>
        <li>Borders</li>
        <li>Padding</li>
        <li>Content</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
        The Box Model Explained
    </h2>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Margin - The area OUTSIDE of the boarder</li>
            <li>Borders - A bounary line surrounding the content and padding around it.</li>
            <li>Padding - The space between the content and and border.</li>
            <li>Content - The media being displayed on the web page.</li>
        </ol>

        Using the box model, we can define a border around any sort of content and then we can define the space between that border and content, or around that border.
